Question 1 :- Given an array of integers and a target value, how can we find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target?
🔍 Example:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: Indices [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] = 9)

Question 2:- You are given a sorted array of integers, and your task is to remove the duplicates in-place, meaning you cannot use extra space for another array. You should ensure that each unique number appears only once, and the order of the unique elements remains unchanged.
Goal:
1. Return the number of unique elements (k) in the modified array.
2. Modify the array so that the first k elements contain the unique values.
3. The remaining elements beyond k don't matter.

Question3: 💡 Problem Breakdown: Remove Element (LeetCode) 💡<br>
Today’s challenge is about removing all occurrences of a specific value from an array, in-place. Here’s the task in simple terms:<br?
🔹 Input: An array of numbers and a specific value (let's call it val).<br>
🔹 Goal: Remove all occurrences of val from the array without using extra space (meaning you need to modify the array itself).<br>
🔹 Output: The number of elements remaining in the array after removing all instances of val.<br>
