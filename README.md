Question 1 :- Given an array of integers and a target value, how can we find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target?
üîç Example:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: Indices [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] = 9)

Question 2:- You are given a sorted array of integers, and your task is to remove the duplicates in-place, meaning you cannot use extra space for another array. You should ensure that each unique number appears only once, and the order of the unique elements remains unchanged.
Goal:
1. Return the number of unique elements (k) in the modified array.
2. Modify the array so that the first k elements contain the unique values.
3. The remaining elements beyond k don't matter.
